# rpi0w-hacker

-   In this Repository we will be exploring the Rpi0w's usefulness in the field as a discreet and effective tool for penetration testing, and overlooking network infrastructure and application security. (This is not a hacking tutorial, this is a professional expression of experiences (2017-202x))
-   It is estimated that 76% of 'hackers' got into it because they were either, too poor to pay people to do things for themselves, or they were not interested with normal lifestyles and found them to be extremely boring.
-   Why the 10$ Board? Because I honor those poor individuals like myself who cannot afford expensive hardware.

## It is not weak
-   Trust me, you will understand what this means. Eventually. Or you will eat Pi and ponder it.

_Lets imagine we were making a sandwich, you try to cram as much as you can between two pieces of bread without it falling apart. Right?_

#### NOW WE CAN HACK FOUR OR FIVE THINGS AT ONCE, BUT IT WONT FIT IN THE POCKET. NOW IT HAS BECOME A BENCH. A PLACE YOU TRY NEW THINGS AND LEARN FROM. THIS IS WHY I DO THIS!

### Words from the dude

" Well, there is a few things you should know.
 I love my Pi's more than my Gaming Rigs. More than my servers. I can put them into my pocket and take the server with me, on solar power. You cannot beat that. Other SBC's and IoT Devices do amazing jobs but nothing does what the little Rpi0w does.
 I have legitimately never broken a Raspberry Pi or any other computer beyond usability. But this project, makes me want to erase that egrogorial statement. I believe now, you will either break a Pi with me, or discover you have NOTHING TO FEAR as I did when I was 9 years old hacking MS-DOS video games and modding them. They call me Diveyez in the music world, because I have divine eyes. Meticulous inspection, never a bad perception. I do not burn horrid images to my drives, mount, and boot them.
 I strongly suggest you review all of this information before doing ANYTHING. You are never safe, until your truly understand everything and believe that you are. Fear is the mind killer, and for the sake of this project, it is also the Raspberry Pi 0w killer. " - Ricky N.
